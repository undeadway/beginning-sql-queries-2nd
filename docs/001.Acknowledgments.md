# 致谢

（致谢实在没啥意思，不想翻译了，略过。有兴趣看原文的，如下。）

> First of all, many, many thanks to my husband, Neville, for reading every chapter and providing so many valuable suggestions. I would like to acknowledge one of my readers, Scott Lawley, who has given me helpful feedback and suggested the terms process approach and outcome approach as being friendlier than algebra and calculus . Thank you to my editor, Jonathan Gennick, for making this second edition possible, and to Jill Balzano for her excellent coordination. Thanks also to my employer, Tai Poutini Polytechnic,for its support.
